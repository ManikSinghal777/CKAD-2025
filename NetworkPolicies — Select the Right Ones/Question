Q16-Scenario

Given 4 existing NetworkPolicies, identify and apply the 2 that allow traffic to a pod labeled:

app=db
tier=backend
Allowed sources:

Pod with labels: app=api, tier=frontend
Pod with labels: role=monitor
Goal

Select/create 2 policies that:

Allow ingress from tier=frontend
Allow ingress from role=monitor
(Practice creating NP manifests based on podSelectors.)

----

* 4 NetworkPolicies already existed

* You were **NOT allowed to edit them**

* You had to:

* Understand their selectors

* Label the correct pods

* Enable communication between **3 pods**

📌 If you understand **label-based matching**, this is free points.
