Q4- A pod within the Deployment named dev-deployment and in namespace meta is logging errors.
1. Look at the logs identify errors messages.
Find errors, including User "system:serviceaccount:meta:default" cannot list resource "deployment" [...] in the namespace meta.
2. Update the Deployment dev-deployment to resolve the errors in the log of the pod.
The dev-deployment's manifest can be found at ~/dev-deployment.yaml
