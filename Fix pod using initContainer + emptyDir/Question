Q18-In namespace `default`, Pod `startup-pod` exists and fails because it tries to execute `/app/start.sh`, which does not exist.

Recreate Pod `startup-pod` so that:

- It uses an `emptyDir` volume mounted at `/app`.
- An init container:

  - Writes `/app/start.sh` with content `echo start app`
  - Marks it executable

- The main container:

  - Runs `/app/start.sh` as its command

Ensure the recreated Pod reaches `Running` state.
