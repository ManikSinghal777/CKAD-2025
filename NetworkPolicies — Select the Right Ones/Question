Q16-Scenario

In namespace default, four NetworkPolicies already exist.

You are NOT allowed to edit existing NetworkPolicies.

A Pod with the following labels exists:
app=db
tier=backend
Traffic to this Pod is currently blocked.

Configure the environment so that ingress traffic is allowed only from:

Pods with labels:
app=api
tier=frontend
Pods with labels:
role=monitor

You may only use labels and existing NetworkPolicies.

Do not modify the NetworkPolicy definitions.
